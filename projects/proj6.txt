Create a Django application which can do the 
following:

a) You can create a new account and log-in (just like
any e-commerce site).

b) Once logged in, you can post a photo and a  description
of an item you want to sell. The description should include
a brief title as well as a more detailed body.

c) When somebody visits the home page of the site (whether he is
logged in or not), he should be
able to see all the items which have been put up for sale. The
items should be displayed as thumbnail images (the thumbnails should
be generated from the posted photo automatically. There are python
libraries which can do this). Each thumbnail should be followed by
the title corresponding to that item. The title should be clickable -
when you click on it, you should be taken to another page which 
contains the original photo as well as description of the item.

Time: 4 days
