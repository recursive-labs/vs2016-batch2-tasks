Note:

You need to do only ONE of the two projects given below; choose whatever
you like.

The students who complete this project properly will have an opportunity to participate
in the selection process of a cochin based company looking for Django developers.
You should write the code cleanly; it will be reviewed by the people at the 
company.

Time limit: 3 days. Please try to complete within the deadline.

After completion, please put up the code on github and mail me the link (personal
mail only).

You are NOT supposed to collaborate with your friends - PLEASE DO THIS IN A
TOTALLY INDEPENDENT WAY. Please take this VERY SERIOUSLY.

The user interface of your project should be reasonably attractive - it will be good if you 
use the "twitter bootstrap" CSS framework

Try to make use of the "jquery" javascript library to show results in
the same page (use jquery AJAX).

---------------
1) Create a personal currency conversion app in django.

* User should have an option to signup and login.
* A simple ui to enter currencies for conversion  (Example: USD to SGD)
* Record above user activities in any database as a string and show in admin panel 
- String example("USD 1 to INR at 22-12-2016")
* Try to show results in the same UI.
*(Optional) You can use http://fixer.io/ for api service in currency conversion.
* No need to provide date in currency conversion api call.
* User should have a choice between these five currencies -  USD, EUR, INR, SGD, GBP

2) Develop a simple RSS reader. The interface is a web page that accepts an RSS URL and 
lays it out on a web page in a simple but visually appealing manner.

* User signup and login needed.
* UI to enter RSS link and show RSS results in same page.

You can use the following feed for testing purposes
