It is a toy interpreter for a Lisp-like language
developed by Peter Norvig.

Your job is to first type the code, run it and understand how
it works perfectly; each and every line should be clear.

Next task is to rewrite the code in C. The C code should
be able to do everything the Python code is capable of doing
and it should give exactly the same output.

The C code should be well-structured (divided into lots
of small functions with meaningful names, no over-use of
global variables, proper indentation, no deep nesting (more
than 2 levels) of if-for-while etc).

The C code should be split up into multiple files.

You should also write a Makefile to automate the compilation
process.

Please ask on the mailing list if you need  any clarifications.

Students are requested not to discuss the design of this program
among each other - all of you should do it   COMPLETELY INDEPENDENTLY.

Don't put up the code on github.com.

Time: 5 days
