After that, create a "paint application" (like
Paintbrush/Windows paint) in pure JS/HTML5. Here
is one such program:

Try to make it as interesting as possible.

Your program need not be able to "SAVE"  drawings.
That is tricky.

Time limit: 1 week (for studying + doing project).

-----------------

Please write properly structured code: divide your program into
as many small functions as possible. Avoid global variables as
far as possible. Give meaningful names to functions/global variables.

Do take this seriously: the people who would be hiring you in  
the future will definitely look at your code.

--------------------

These 'projects' are the means by which I will be "evaluating"
you to find out what kinds of jobs I can refer you to. So please
take them seriously.

-----------------------

Please make sure you DISCUSS on the group if some aspect 
of the project is not clear to you.
