Write a minimal "web server" program in
Python using the "socket" library.


A browser (firefox, chrome, whatever) should be able to
request .html, .txt and image files (.gif, .png, .jpg)
and the server should deliver them  properly.

Note1: You should know HTTP basics: https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html

Note2: You should NOT use high-level Python libraries which
provide web server functionality (like https://docs.python.org/2/library/basehttpserver.html)

Note3: First make sure you are comfortable with "socket programming"
in Python by writing simple programs like chat; use both UDP and TCP.
For writing the web server, you will have to use TCP.


Time: 5 days
-------------------------------
Bonus points if you can do this:


The web server should be able to handle concurrent
connections using the   "fork" system call.
