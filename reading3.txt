Look at the abstracts of a few videos and watch any one video
fully.

Create a brief 1 page writeup (using Open/LibreOffice or LaTeX -
it is highly recommended that you try out LaTeX if you haven't
done it before) explaining the key ideas presented in the talk.

Put up the PDF version of this writeup in a github repo called 
"pycon-talks" and mail the link to the group.

Please complete this within 4 days.
