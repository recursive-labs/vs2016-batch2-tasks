a) Using the "ssh" command, log on to the 
following remote system:

IP address: 128.199.254.186

user name: guest
password: cpython1234


b) The actual questions for this test are stored in
a file called:

qns.txt

on the remote system.  You will have to find out where 
this file is located.

c) Create a directory (under /home/guest which is your
login directory) - the name of the directory
should match your name; for example:

cd /home/guest  
mkdir arjun   

d) All the answers to the test questions should be
found out by running commands on the remote system.
The answers should be stored in a file called "ans.txt"
under the folder which you have created (say "arjun").


e) It will be necessary to create some files as part of the
solution to some of the test questions. ALL files you create
should be under the folder which you have created. As all of
you are working under the same login("guest"), unless you work under
different folders, it will create a lot of confusion.
